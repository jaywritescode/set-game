# set-game
That Set game that's a thing.

I finally got the solitaire version up and running on Heroku! Until I get around to twiddling with my DNS settings, it's at https://guarded-fortress-9683.herokuapp.com/?t=solitaire.

### build
transmuting amazing ES6 into lame ES5: `gulp babel`
installing the server: `source env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`

### execute local
~~~sh
python setapp.py
